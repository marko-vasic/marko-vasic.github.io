  <h1 id="quotes—i—like">Quotes I Like</h1>
  <p>I am inspired by quotes, and by the fact that people over
  thousands of years have put words of wisdom in such a succinct form
  that is eternally applicable. I read somewhere that if we only
  followed the wisdom people put in the quotes we would not need any
  other help in our life. That being said, I was collecting a list of
  quotes for quite some time, bellow I will put just a few for now,
  until I compile and select from the list.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Luck favors the prepared mind. —Louis Pasteur</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A Bit Of Fragrance Clings To The Hand That Gives Flowers. —Chinese proverb</p>
    <li>
      <p>It is in the character of very few men to honor without envy
        a friend who has prospered. —Aeschylus</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>It is not what you endure that matters, but how you endure
        it. —Seneca</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>I do not believe in taking the right decision, I take a decision and
make it right. —Muhammad Ali Jinnah </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Stop comparing yourself to who you wanna be, as you are
        comparing their finish line with your start line. —UNK</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Vlad was right. There are no choices. Nothing but a straight
        line. The illusion comes afterwards, when you ask 'Why me?'
        and 'What if?' when you look back, see the branches, like a
        pruned bonsai tree, or a forked lightning. If you had done
        something differently, it wouldn't be you, it would be someone
        else looking back, asking a different set of questions. —Max Payne </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they
      listen with the intent to reply. —Stephen Covey</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to
      overlook. —William James</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a
        target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like
        happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does
        so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication
        to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's
        surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must
        happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it
        happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what
        your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out
        to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that
        in the long-run—in the long-run, I say!—success will follow
        you precisely because you had forgotten to think about
        it. —Viktor Frankl </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>A problem is only a problem if you decide not to deal with
      it. There are no problems, there are only situations. —Tim
      Grover (Jordan's coach)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>You don't need to and you can't love all aspects of your work,
      but you have to be addicted to results. —Tim Grover (Jordan's
      coach)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>To learn to succeed you must first learn to fail. —Michael
      Jordan</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The mental toughness and the heart are a lot stronger than some
      of the physical advantages you might have. I’ve always said that
      and I’ve always believed that. —Michael Jordan</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>My serenity is inversely proportional to my expectations. The
        higher my expectations of other people are, the lower is my
        serenity. —UNK</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Nothing I say this day will teach me anything. So if I’m going
      to learn, I must do it by listening. —Larry King</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>One should not pursue goals that are easily achieved. One must
      develop an instinct for what one can just barely achieve through
      one’s greatest efforts. —Albert Einstein</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Love cannot be found there where it does not exist, nor it can
      be hidden there where it exists. (original: Ljubav se ne može
      naći tamo gde je nema, niti se može sakriti tamo gde je ima.)
      —Ivo Andrić</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who
      fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who
      rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity. —Henry van
      Dyke</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back
      to its old dimensions. —Oliver Wendell Holmes</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Challenges are what make life interesting and overcoming them is
      what makes life meaningful. —Joshua J. Marine</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If you want happiness for an hour — take a nap. If you want
      happiness for a day — go fishing. If you want happiness for a
      year — inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a life time
      — help someone else. —Chinese Proverb</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>When one door of happiness closes, another opens, but often
        we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one
        that has been opened for us. —Helen Keller</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Life is a tower on a hill from which 1000 windows watch at
        1000 directions. One great amount of courage comes to a man
        from this idea solely: there's always another way to
        happiness, and not only the one used so far
        unsuccessfully. (original: Život je kula na bregu sa koje
        hiljadu prozora gledaju na hiljadu strana vidika. Jedna
        ogromna količina hrabrosti dolazi čoveku od samo ove ideje: da
        uvek ima još jedan put ka sreći, a ne samo onaj kojim je dotle
        bezuspešno išao da je postigne.). —Dučić</p>
